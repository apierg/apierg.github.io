excerpt: "We propose MAGNET-MAchines GeNErating Translations, a CALAMITA Challenge which aims at testing the ability of large language models (LLMs) in the hot topic of automatic translation, focusing on Italian and English (in both directions) to overcome the marginality with which Italian is considered by the machine translation community. We propose a benchmark composed of two portions with different distribution policies (one free to use, the other not discloseable), allowing to handle data contamination issues. The publicly available section of the benchmark is distributed on Hugging Face, whereas in this report we describe the details of our challenge, including the prompt formats to be used. Additionally, we report the performance of five models, including a LLM and different sized translation models, in terms of four evaluation metrics, whose scores allow an overall evaluation of the quality of the automatically generated translations."
